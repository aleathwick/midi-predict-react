# Humanizing Midi Piano Sequences In-Browser

This repository takes models from [my honours project](https://github.com/aleathwick/781-piano-autoencoder)predicting note velocities from and makes them available in browser here: http://aleathwick.github.io/781-midi-predict/midiPredict.html

This version is built with react, improving the interface over [the original non-react version](https://github.com/aleathwick/781-midi-predict).
