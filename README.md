# Humanizing Midi Piano Sequences In-Browser

This repository takes models for predicting note velocities from [my honours project](https://github.com/aleathwick/781-piano-autoencoder) and makes them available in browser. See here: https://aleathwick.github.io/midi-predict-react/

This version is built with react, improving the interface over [the original non-react version](https://github.com/aleathwick/781-midi-predict).
